# Choir Companion

## About
Being a church musician and singer, I've often found myself in various leadership roles pertaining to choirs and ensembles. One of the problems that is often ran into is clean, efficient, and non-laborious way to communicate to a group while providing a hub that can store all important information and updates. I developed Choir Companion as a communication and information hub to address said issues.

## Link to App
https://choircompanion.herokuapp.com/
backend Git Hub: https://github.com/mjlessington/choircompanionserver


## Technologies Used
React (w/Hooks), Express, Sockets.io, Material UI, Auth0 SDK, deployed to Heroku

## Future Developments
1. Making the chats persistant.
2. Development into a mobile app.
3. Connect to MusixMatch as an API, but subscription to be paid per the client.
4. Working with a team of UI/UX professionals to fully develop into a great experience for the users
5. A video component for virtual rehearsal in the app.

## Roadblocks/Challenges
1. Re-configuring the app for production.
2. Over-engineering and over-thinking. The most resonating statement when I sought help for one problem was this: "Mell, you doing too much." Such liberating word!
3. Trying to be UX/UI and SE at the same time.
